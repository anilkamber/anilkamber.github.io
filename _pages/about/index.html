My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization theory, compressed sensing and theoretical neuroscience.</p> <p>I received my bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from <a href="https://bogazici.edu.tr/en_us" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bogazici University</a>, Istanbul, Turkey. My bachelor’s thesis, titled <a href="https://github.com/anlkamber3/polytopic-matrix-factorization-eeg" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Blind Source Separation in Neuroscience</a>, which was advised by <a href="https://aspc.ku.edu.tr/alper-t-erdogan" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Alper Erdogan</a> and <a href="https://vavlab.bogazici.edu.tr/people" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Burak Acar</a>, won the Cenker Oden Senior Design Project Award, awarded for the best theoretical undergraduate research. Additionally, I derived the channel response of a SISO molecular communication via diffusion system in a 3-D half-space with an infinite reflecting surface, under the supervision of <a href="https://academics.boun.edu.tr/ali.pusane/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Ali Emre Pusane</a>.</p> </body></html>
