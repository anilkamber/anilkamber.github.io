I am a second year Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD student at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) [Jacobs School of Engineering](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/), advised by [Rahul Parhi](https://sparsity.ucsd.edu/rahul/).

I am exploring the mysteries of optimization dynamics in neural networks and transformer-based architectures. In particular, I am trying to understand why these models generalize well despite being highly overparameterized.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Bogazici University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en_us), Istanbul, Turkey. My bachelor's thesis, titled [Blind Source Separation in Neuroscience](https://github.com/anlkamber3/polytopic-matrix-factorization-eeg), which was advised by [Alper Erdogan](https://aspc.ku.edu.tr/alper-t-erdogan) and [Burak Acar](https://vavlab.bogazici.edu.tr/people), won the Cenker Oden Senior Design Project Award, awarded for the best theoretical undergraduate research. Additionally, I derived the channel response of a SISO molecular communication via diffusion system in a 3-D half-space with an infinite reflecting surface, under the supervision of [Ali Emre Pusane](https://academics.boun.edu.tr/ali.pusane/).

Moreover, I am also interested in theoretical neuroscience.
