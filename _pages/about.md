I am a first year Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD student at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) [Jacobs School of Engineering](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/).

I am interested in the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence. Therefore, my research interests lie at the intersection of optimization theory, compressed sensing, and theoretical neuroscience.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Bogazici University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en_us), Istanbul, Turkey. My bachelor's thesis, titled [Blind Source Separation in Neuroscience](https://github.com/anlkamber3/polytopic-matrix-factorization-eeg), which was advised by Prof. Alper Erdogan and Prof. Burak Acar, won the [Cenker Oden Senior Design Project Award](https://github.com/anlkamber3/polytopic-matrix-factorization-eeg), awarded for the best theoretical undergraduate research. Additionally, I derived the channel response of the SISO molecular communication via diffusion system in a 3-D half-space with an infinite reflecting surface under supervision of Prof. Ali Emre Pusane.
