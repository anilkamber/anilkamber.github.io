I am a first year Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD student at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) [Jacobs School of Engineering](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/).

I am interested in the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence. My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization theory, compressed sensing and theoretical neuroscience.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Bogazici University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en_us), Istanbul, Turkey. My bachelor's thesis, titled [Blind Source Separation in Neuroscience](https://github.com/anlkamber3/polytopic-matrix-factorization-eeg), which was advised by [Prof. Alper Erdogan](https://aspc.ku.edu.tr/alper-t-erdogan/) and [Prof. Burak Acar](https://vavlab.bogazici.edu.tr/people), won the Cenker Oden Senior Design Project Award, awarded for the best theoretical undergraduate research. Additionally, I derived the channel response of a SISO molecular communication via diffusion system in a 3-D half-space with an infinite reflecting surface, under the supervision of [Prof. Ali Emre Pusane](https://academics.boun.edu.tr/ali.pusane/).

Currently, I am working on theoretical foundations of neural networks and deep learning with [Prof. Rahul Parhi](https://sparsity.ucsd.edu/rahul/).
